      I'm a software engineer and engineering manager with over 10 years experience. I'm currently at Shopify, making
      commerce better for everyone. I live in Ottawa, Canada, with my wonderful wife Sammy, and our dog Poppy. I care
      deeply about laughter and have currently fallen in love with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I feel an earnest desire to
      increase the stock of harmless cheerfulness and to support those around me.

     Eemeli has discovered that writing code is much more enjoyable when you don’t need to account for your hours to
     anyone. On the other hand, this does mean that you end up going ever deeper to fix things. He maintains the
     [`messageformat`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/messageformat) and [`yaml`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml) JS
     libraries along with a host of others, and actively participates in various efforts to improve JavaScript
     localization. For work, he mostly develops libraries and tools for customers’ front-end development teams. For
     fun, he organises science fiction conventions. Eemeli is a voting member of the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/)
     Cross Project Council, an active participant in ECMA-402 processes, runs the monthly [HelsinkiJS](https://helsinkijs.org/)
     meetups, and helps organise [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/) conferences.
