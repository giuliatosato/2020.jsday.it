  title: Building your first malicious chrome extension
  extract: >
    "Building chrome extension is simple & fun. In this talk I will explain the basics of building your first chrome extension, 
    in just a couple of minutes! We will then speak about the various ways to turn your awesome extension to a malicious one. 
    The main purpose here is not to turn you into a hacker, but instead to understand the risks of extensions, and to increase 
    awareness to these "small" and "harmless" plugins."

  title: How AI can boost your app development process?
  extract: >
    I'm a person who hates boring, repetitive work, so I'm always looking for a way to avoid it. It's how my master
    thesis project was designed. Based on existing solutions I built my AI-based tool to autogenerate the app's interface
    in Nativescript from hand-written sketches. Thanks to that you can generate in some seconds a full app interface in
    some seconds and during the first meeting with clients collect much better feedback than normally, avoid wasting
    time and money for changes during development. And even it's not perfect (yet!) I believe it's an interesting way
    for future front-end development. During my talk, I want to show not only my approach but also the other ones that
    may help you decrease the time needed for app deployment: AI-based (like UIzard) and "traditional" ones like Figma or JHipster.

    A review of the current tools, libraries and specifications available for localization and message formatting in
    JavaScript. Covering everything from recent additions to the language to framework-specific front-end libraries and
    server-side tools. What to take into account when selecting your own solutions, including integration with other
    languages and systems as well as the needs and expectations of translators. Noting in particular which early decisions
    are significant and hard to reverse later, and which are trivial to refactor. Also featuring a look at where the
    current specification work is at, and where it might be going next.

  title: Node.js architecture with Nest (workshop)
  extract: >
    Nest is a framework for building efficient and scalable web applications using nodeJS. Built with TypeScript, with
    the software design architecture applied by Angular. For this, concepts such as controllers, models, ORMs,
    middleware, pipes, guards, interceptors, dependency injection, unit tests and e2e are available. In addition,
    NestJS allows the use of websockets, microservices or graphQL. The goal of this workshop, is to learn how to start
    an application with Nest, in addition to learning how to increase productivity when creating server-side applications
    with nodeJS, as well as some good practices. Throughout this workshop, a simple RESTful API will be built with
    several endpoints in which roles, guards, validations etc will be used. The key to this workshop is to discover
    how to create scalable, maintainable and extensible applications in the node.js ecosystem.

  extract: >
    Everybody’s talking about them, but nobody’s doing them. Well, we took up the challenge, and are. 
    What I am going to show is how we implemented a Monorepo project, and why. The nuts and bolts of creating a repo based on npm packages,
    the structure of the code of the apps in the monorepo, and creating packages with the common code. 
    Also, and maybe most importantly, how we test the whole thing, how we build the project, how we deploy it in production, 
    and how we monitor it. It’s going to be a really boring talk, full of lots of tips we learned in blood in the last year of 
    implementing this. So be prepared to be bored! And, hopefully, educated…

    Math. Computer science. Computers were invented to do complicated mathematics. But JavaScript wasn’t. It was
    created to assemble components and be written directly in web page markup. So how does Math fit into all of this?
    Well, JavaScript has had a Math object since its inception in 1997. Sooo, exactly how much math can we do with
    JavaScript? Let’s do some exploration together. From sine to log to hypotenuse, we’ll wind our way through the
    Math object in JavaScript and see just how closely we can mimic a graphing calculator. Let’s travel back in time
    and use computer science to do math again! I’ll discuss the history of math, computer science, and JavaScript.
    Then we’ll hop forward in time and do tons of wacky mathematics using JavaScript’s impressively extensive Math
    object. Come with me, and you’ll see, a world of pure mathemagination… in JavaScript.

  title: Building CLI Tools With NodeJS
  extract: >
    Nobody questions building back ends with NodeJS anymore. It’s proven itself and is widely accepted as a great platform for web servers. 
    But have you ever thought of building CLI tools with NodeJS? Turns out that NodeJS is also great at that. 
    By using just a few simple built-in modules, you can create powerful tools that can be used in terminals in all operating systems. 
    In this talk, the attendees will learn how to use those modules through some practical code samples and demos.

  title: How vulnerable is your App? and how to fix it.
  extract: >
    The essence of this talk is enlightening frontend developers of security risks, how to spot them and fix them.
    The techniques discussed in this talk are framework agnostic so it can be applied to all JS frameworks, from my
    research a lot of companies lose money because security is an afterthought or some think they are too small to
    be attacked and sometimes it just wasn't properly implemented. I intend to start from the known to the less known
    security considerations and walk the audience through this in such a way that beginners are also carried along.

    This talk explores a project I worked on for the University of Alberta, where we build a web-based EEG monitor using React and RxJS. 
    Using these technologies we can stream live EEG data to the browser, process it in real-time, and begin to look for patterns or irregularities. 
    The project was complex and incredible to work on, and the use cases are still being discovered.

    Voxnest is the leading platform for dynamic advertising in the podcasting world. 
    One of the core parts of our proprietary stack is an in-house Ad server, written in Node.js and deployed using serverless technologies,
    that handles more than 10 million requests per day. In this talk, the Voxnest development team will tell you a classic story of rising 
    from the trenches of a humble Node.js prototype, in five acts: 1. Running on the green fields (The Prototype); 
    2. Climbing the first hills (The Traction); 3. The first peak of the mountain (The Climax); 
    4. Stuck at the basecamp (The Struggle); 5. Back on track to the peak (The Resolution). 
    The talk will include a particularly deep dive into how Voxnest’s developers dealt with the classic "evolve vs rewrite" dilemma, 
    and how TypeScript helped them find a sweet spot.

    The web is fast becoming the main means through which people interact with all sorts of technologies. With every
    new invention, users ask "but can it work with a browser?" With Web APIs, the answer is almost always yes; even to
    the question "can you fly a drone with a banana?" In this talk, I show the audience the power of APIs and discuss a
    few cool experimental APIs. I do this by taking them through on a journey through my experience of trying to hack
    a drone and fly it with a banana. If you're interested in all things web, custom controllers, Bluetooth technology
    and accelerometer-based controls or if you just like fruit and seeing silly applications of technology, this talk
    is for you.

    The web has an ecological impact. We know it, that is a fact. As a concerned citizen and a web developer, I have
    been trying to reduce the web’s impact for a year. But what impact exactly? When it is time to estimate the impact,
    we are less confident. Focusing on the Netflix login page, I will estimate the CO2 cost of this particular page
    following the requests through user devices, network and datacenters. The audience will learn how to reduce their
    ecological impact as a web user and a web actor, and how to imagine the web of tomorrow.

  title: Testing in Production
  extract: >
    Testing in production is the only way to know that your software is working right now in production. It not only
    increases developer confidence in the code, but also increases development velocity because you will spend less
    time fixing bugs and more time building new products. This approach provides an increased accuracy of test results,
    faster test execution time due to elimination of bad data, and you will have higher confidence before releases
    because you already know that your features will work before you launch. I will show you how to mitigate risk,
    improve your understanding of the steps to get there, and shift your company’s testing culture to provide the best
    possible experience to your users. I will talk about the way to run tests in the production environment of a system,
    how to do it without disrupting real end users, and how to exclude testing data from data and analytics. I will also
    talk about the tools that help in this process, the benefits of testing in production, why the pros outweigh the cons,
    and why it's more reliable.

  title: Building a Delay: Recreating an Analogue Delay Pedal with the Web Audio API, JS, and CSS
  extract: >
    This talk is a high-level introduction to the Web Audio API, focussing on the concept of a "signal path", and how this translates into
    JavaScript. Our mission will be to recreate an analogue delay pedal in the browser (and add in some CSS and SVG just for fun!). 
    We'll generate some simple sounds, and then apply "delay time" and "feedback level" to our browser's signal path. 
    We'll also look at how we get from `source` (an audio file or input stream) to `destination` (speakers or headphones). 
    The overall aim is to create a greater awareness of power of the Web Audio API; you can do a lot more with audio in the browser 
    than people think you can. Along the way, we'll also see that CSS isn't a scary mess. It can be precise and beautiful (and fun!). 
    Web development can be fun; the browser is a quick and easy environment to code for (if creativity and experimentation are your goals).

    Every other website on the internet uses third party trackers to improve their product and provide better user
    experience, which eventually leads to a compromise in user privacy. As developers, we are responsible for making
    our users feel safe and do whatever it takes to secure the privacy of our users. In this talk we will discuss the
    data leaks which happen while using third party services and will walk through the measures we can take to avoid
    them and ensure the privacy of our users, right from the time of development.

  title: How to do Good Without Doing Anything
  extract: >
    There’s no arguing that building accessible websites is a force for good. Everyone, regardless of ability or
    disability, ought to have the right to participate on the web. But ensuring that our websites and apps work for
    everyone can be time consuming and isn’t always easy to get right. Luckily, like most things in programming,
    investing a little bit of extra time on your accessibility workflow and setting up a series of automated tools
    will end up saving you tons of time and energy in the long run. In this talk I will lay out a set of processes
    that can reduce your time spent identifying, debugging and testing accessibility support in your applications. I
    will discuss the ways that I automate certain aspects of my development workflows to catch accessibility errors,
    define and set up e2e tests for accessibility and go through the entire lifecycle of accessibility feature development
    using a real world example.
