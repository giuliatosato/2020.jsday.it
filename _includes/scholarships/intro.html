            We are involved in many ways in order to build a better environment in tech for everyone. In 2017 we became
            <strong>Diversity Sponsor</strong> of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1817732114/the-phpdiversity-rainbow-elephpant">The PHPDiversity Rainbow Elephpant campaign on Kickstarter</a>
            when the project was seemingly about to end without making it. We are very proud that many others followed us
            and that the project reached its goal.
            As we want to do more we are pleased to announce our <strong>Scholarships for jsDay 2020</strong>. We are
            committed to enabling as many people as possible to attend our conference, and to promoting an inclusive
            community; last year we introduced a ticket scholarship scheme to encourage students, under-represented groups
            and those who can't otherwise afford tickets to experience the event.
        </p>
        <p class="scholarships__description">
            Preference will be given to members of under-represented groups in technology - women, minorities, LGBTQIA+,
            people with disabilities, or other under-represented groups; but consideration will be given to anybody who
            would otherwise be unable to attend without financial assistance.
        </p>
        <p class="scholarships__description">
            These scholarships are made possible thanks to our <strong>Diversity Support Tickets</strong> initiative and the support
            received by <a href="http://www.grusp.org/it/">GrUSP</a>.
